*To the students, educators, and researchers*

*who believe that robots can extend human capability*

*and bring intelligence to the physical world.*

*To the open-source community*

*whose collaborative spirit makes knowledge accessible*

*and innovation possible for all.*

*And to the humanoid robots of tomorrow—*

*may they serve humanity with wisdom, safety, and purpose.*
